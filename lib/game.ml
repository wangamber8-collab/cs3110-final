(* PURPOSE: canonicalize a string for answer comparison so "July", " July ",
   and "july" all match the same node.
   STEPS:
     1. Trim leading/trailing whitespace.
     2. Lowercase every ASCII letter.
   NOTE: internal whitespace is preserved — answers like "Apollo 11" need
   the space between tokens. *)
let normalize (_s : string) : string = failwith "TODO"

(* PURPOSE: split a label on {N} placeholders into alternating literal text
   and slot markers. The ONLY place that understands {N} syntax — the parser
   and Types treat labels as opaque strings.
   STEPS:
     1. Scan the input for the pattern "{<digits>}".
     2. Emit Text s for each stretch of literal text between/around placeholders.
     3. Emit Slot i for each {i} encountered.
   EXAMPLE:
     "like most {0}lin and {1} movies"
     -> [ Text "like most "; Slot 0; Text "lin and "; Slot 1; Text " movies" ]
   NOTE: this does NOT recurse into children. Nesting is handled by
   render_node, which calls itself on children.(i) when it sees Slot i. *)
let tokenize_label (_label : string) : label_part list = failwith "TODO"

(* PURPOSE: render one node to its display string in the current state.
   Called recursively — a node's slots are filled by rendering its children.
   STEPS:
     1. If n.solved -> return n.answer verbatim, WITHOUT brackets.
     2. Else tokenize n.label and walk the token list, building a body:
          - Text s -> append s
          - Slot i -> append (render_node (List.nth n.children i))
     3. Wrap the body as "[" ^ body ^ "]" and return. *)
let rec render_node (_n : game_node) : string = failwith "TODO"

(* PURPOSE: produce the full puzzle display string shown to the player.
   STEPS:
     1. Call render_node on state.root.
     2. Strip the outermost "[" and "]" — the root isn't inside anything,
        so the final string (e.g. "GM makes its 100 millionth car") should
        not be bracketed. *)
let render (_s : state) : string = failwith "TODO"

(* PURPOSE: collect every node the player can currently attempt —
   unsolved nodes whose children are ALL solved. At start these are the leaves.
   STEPS:
     1. DFS from state.root.
     2. At each unsolved node n:
          - if every child of n is solved -> include n (stop recursing here;
            the subtree below is fully solved).
          - else recurse into n's unsolved children to find deeper exposed nodes.
     3. Return the collected list. *)
let exposed (_s : state) : game_node list = failwith "TODO"

(* PURPOSE: accept a user answer; if it matches an exposed node's answer,
   return a new state with that node flipped to solved.
   ASSUMPTION: puzzle answers are unique across the whole tree, so at most
   one node can match a given input.
   STEPS:
     1. Let input' = normalize input.
     2. Find the unique node n where:
          - n is exposed (unsolved, all children solved), AND
          - normalize n.answer = input'.
     3. If found -> rebuild the tree with n.solved = true; return (new_state, true).
        If not found -> return (state, false) unchanged. *)
let submit (_input : string) (_s : state) : state * bool = failwith "TODO"

(* PURPOSE: has the player won?
   Root is solved iff every descendant has been solved — submit only flips a
   node when all its children are already solved, so root.solved reflects it. *)
let is_won (_s : state) : bool = failwith "TODO"
